# Memory Match Game

## What is it?
A simple game of turning over two cards at a time and trying to match all eight pairs.

## How?
This game is made in vanilla JavaScript and styled using CSS flexbox and grid. Since no frameworks were used, no dependencies need to be installed. You can simply download the files in the public folder and open index.html to try it out.

## Why?
This is my solo work submission for my [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) cohort.

I chose to go framework-free because I thought it would enable a lean, minimalistic approach to the challenge. It also loads quite fast.
